PL/0 Project's Source Tree
==========================

1. Introduction

PL/0 is similar to but much simpler than the general-purpose 
programming language Pascal, intended as an educational programming 
language. It serves as an example of how to construct a compiler. 
It was originally introduced in the book, 
            Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, 
by Niklaus Wirth in 1975.  

This README contains basic information about building, and running
PL/0 or its extended compiler.
If you're running on a Linux system, then just make sure you have
the standard GCC installed.

2. Source Tree
This PL/0 project distribution includes the following files and 
directories:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
README		this file
Makefile	a makefile to build PL/0 compiler or its extension
make.simple	a simple makefile to build PL/0 compiler
src		directory storing source files
include		directory storing header files
test		directory storing test files and their results
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The following directories are recommended to store objective files,
execution files and documents for your project.
doc		directory storing documents
bin		directory storing execution/objective files

3. Building PL/0 compiler
(Build PL/0 compiler)
   $ make
or 
   $ make -f make.simple

(Clean PL/0 compiler)
   $ make clean
or 
   $ make -f make.simple clean

4. Running PL/0 compiler
   $ bin/pl0
   please input source program file name: test/tests.pl0
or   
   $ cd bin
   $ ./pl0
   please input source program file name: test/tests.pl0
or
   $ bin/pl0 >test/t.res
   then input "test/tests.pl0"
